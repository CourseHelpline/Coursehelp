DESCRIPTION: 
Our website provides a platform to avail course registration guidence to those who are in need to pursue higher education. Our services are unbeatable and is the first of its kind in the country. The services that we provide are designed and created by keeping the customers as our primary focus. 
That's all about our site in a nutshell. To see more, you can use the instructions given below to set it up on your local machine. 

INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. Once you have cloned the repo to your local machine, you can run them after putting them in a local server such as a wamp server or xampp server.
    2. Open the location of the www or htdocs folder from the installation directory of wamp or xampp respectively. Copy the files from repo to that directory. Creating an additional folder makes it easy for you to organize them later on when you add in more projects.
    3. After ensuring that the server is running, navigate to phpmyadmin to give connections to the database. You can use the sql file available in the repo to import the necessary tables for this system.
    4. Now you can view the site in all its glory by navigating to the index file from the web browsers search bar. It should look something similar to this - localhost/folder_name/index.php
    5. That's all folks :)
